## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What We're Building

A static website that pulls content from Google Sheets, making it easy for non-technical members to update events and team information. Images are hosted on Cloudinary for easy drag-and-drop management.

### 1.2 Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Last Updated |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| ✅ Google Sheets API Integration | **COMPLETE** | January 2026 |
| ✅ Environment Configuration | **COMPLETE** | January 2026 |
| ✅ Data Fetching (7 data types) | **COMPLETE** | January 2026 |
| ✅ Error Handling & Fallback | **COMPLETE** | January 2026 |
| ✅ Type Safety (TypeScript) | **COMPLETE** | January 2026 |
| 🟡 Cloudinary Integration | **READY** (setup required) | January 2026 |
| ✅ Documentation | **COMPLETE** | January 2026 |

### 1.3 Architecture

The system consists of four components working together:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Google Sheets** | Stores all text content (events, team members) |
| **Cloudinary** | Hosts and optimizes all images |
| **GitHub** | Stores website code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) |
| **Netlify or Render** | Hosts and serves the website |

**Data Flow:**
```
Google Sheets + Cloudinary Images → Website Code (GitHub) → Hosting Platform → Visitors
```

### 1.4 Primary & Fallback Strategy

| Layer | Plan A (Primary) | Plan B (Fallback) |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Data** | Google Sheets API | CSV Publish to Web |
| **Images** | Cloudinary | GitHub Repository |
| **Hosting** | Netlify or Render | Either works |

### 1.5 Cost Summary

| Service | Free Limit | Typical Usage | Long-term Viability |
|---------|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Netlify/Render | 100 GB bandwidth/month | ~50,000 visits | ✅ Excellent |
| Google Sheets | Unlimited | No issues | ✅ Excellent |
| Cloudinary | 25 credits/month | ~10 GB storage | ✅ Excellent |
| GitHub | Unlimited repos | Code + backup images | ✅ Excellent |

**Total Monthly Cost: $0**

## 2. Google Sheets Setup

### 2.1 ✅ Current Implementation

**Status: COMPLETE & WORKING**

The Google Sheets API integration has been successfully implemented with the following features:

#### Implemented Features
- ✅ Generic `fetchSheetData<T>()` utility function
- ✅ 7 specialized data fetch functions:
  - Events data
  - Managing Committee members
  - Annual Reports
  - Past Presidents
  - Core Committees
  - President's Message
  - Custom committee member grouping
- ✅ Smart type conversions (numbers, booleans, dates, arrays)
- ✅ Date format conversion (DD/MM/YYYY → YYYY-MM-DD)
- ✅ CSV parsing for comma-separated fields (tags)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with try/catch
- ✅ Fallback to local JSON on API failure
- ✅ Loading states in all pages
- ✅ TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured (.env.local not tracked)

#### Key Files
- `utils/googleSheets.ts` - Core API integration (200 lines)
- `.env.local` - API credentials (git-ignored)
- `.env.example` - Environment template
- `pages/Events.tsx` - Events data integration
- `pages/About.tsx` - Multiple data sources in parallel
- `pages/Home.tsx` - President's message integration

### 2.2 Understanding the Data Flow

Google Sheets stores your content, but websites cannot read spreadsheets directly. We need a **bridge** — a way for the website's code to request and receive that spreadsheet data.

There are two methods to achieve this, and we recommend having both ready.

### 2.3 Plan A: Google Sheets API (Recommended) ✅

**What it is:** The official Google API that returns structured JSON data. Requires a free API key from Google Cloud Console.

**Why it's better:**
- Official and reliable — Google maintains it
- Returns clean, structured JSON data
- Better error handling capabilities
- No CORS (cross-origin) issues

#### Setup Steps

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project (name it something like "Association Website")
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Library**
4. Search for and enable **Google Sheets API**
5. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
6. Click **Create Credentials** → **API Key**
7. Restrict the key (see Security section below)

#### API URL Pattern

```
https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/[SHEET_ID]/values/[TAB_NAME]?key=[API_KEY]
```

#### API Key Security (Critical!)

Since this is a client-side application, your API key will be visible in the browser. You **must** restrict it to prevent abuse.

**In Google Cloud Console:**

1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Click your API key → **Edit API key**
3. Under **Application restrictions**:
   - Select **HTTP referrers (websites)**
   - Add your domains:
     - `yoursite.netlify.app/*`
     - `www.yourdomain.com/*`
     - `yourdomain.com/*`
4. Under **API restrictions**:
   - Select **Restrict key**
   - Choose only **Google Sheets API**
5. Set a daily quota limit (e.g., 10,000 requests)
6. Click **Save**

### 2.4 Plan B: Publish to Web (Fallback)

**What it is:** Google Sheets can publish your data as a web-accessible CSV file. Your website fetches this URL and parses the data.

**Limitations:**
- Data may cache for up to 5 minutes before updates appear
- Can occasionally face CORS issues in some browsers
- Less reliable — format could change without notice

#### Setup Steps

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to **File** → **Share** → **Publish to web**
3. Select the specific tab (e.g., "events")
4. Choose format: **Comma-separated values (.csv)**
5. Click **Publish**
6. Copy the generated URL

#### CSV URL Pattern

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/[LONG_ID]/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv
```

### 2.5 Create the Spreadsheet ✅

Create a Google Sheet with **two tabs**:

#### Tab 1: `events`

| title | date | description | image |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| Annual Meet 2025 | 2025-03-15 | Our yearly gathering | [Cloudinary URL] |
| Workshop Series | 2025-04-10 | Monthly skill building | [Cloudinary URL] |

#### Tab 2: `teams`

| name | role | department | image |
|------|------|------------|-------|
| John Doe | President | Executive | [Cloudinary URL] |
| Jane Smith | Secretary | Executive | [Cloudinary URL] |

#### Important Configuration

- **Column headers must be exactly as shown** (lowercase, no spaces)
- **Lock the header row:** Select row 1 → View → Freeze → 1 row
- **Set sharing:** Click Share → Anyone with the link → Viewer
- **Copy the Sheet ID** from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[THIS_IS_YOUR_SHEET_ID]/edit`

### 2.6 Protecting Your Sheet

To prevent accidental changes to structure:

1. **Protect header row:**
   - Right-click row 1 → Protect range
   - Set permissions to only allow specific editors

2. **Add data validation for dates:**
   - Select the date column
   - Data → Data validation → Date

3. **Use dropdown for departments:**
   - Select department column
   - Data → Data validation → List of items
   - Enter: Executive, Operations, Marketing, etc.

## 3. Cloudinary Image Hosting

### 3.1 🟡 Current Implementation Status

**Status: READY FOR SETUP**

The website code is already Cloudinary-ready! No code changes are required.

#### What's Already Working
- ✅ Image URL fields in Google Sheets (imageUrl, photoUrl)
- ✅ Image display in all pages (Events, About, Home)
- ✅ Error handling for broken images (fallback placeholders)
- ✅ Responsive image rendering
- ✅ Loading states while images load

#### What You Need to Do
1. Create a Cloudinary account (5 minutes)
2. Set up folder structure (2 minutes)
3. Upload images and paste URLs into Google Sheets
4. (Optional) Add `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` to `.env.local`

**See the detailed guide:** [docs/cloudinary-guide.md](docs/cloudinary-guide.md)

### 3.2 What is Cloudinary?

Cloudinary is a cloud service that stores, optimizes, and delivers images. Instead of uploading images to GitHub (which requires technical knowledge), you upload them to Cloudinary using simple drag-and-drop, then paste the URL into your Google Sheet.

#### Cloudinary vs GitHub for Images

| Aspect | GitHub | Cloudinary |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Upload method | Requires Git knowledge | Drag-and-drop |
| Compression | Manual (you do it) | Automatic |
| CDN | Not included | Global CDN included |
| URL handling | Filename must match exactly | Just copy/paste URL |
| Non-technical friendly | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

### 3.3 Free Tier Limits

Cloudinary's free plan is **not time-limited**. You can use it indefinitely as long as you stay within the usage limits.

| Resource | Free Allowance | What It Means |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Credits | 25 per month | Flexible usage units |
| Storage | 10 GB | ~2,000 high-quality photos |
| Bandwidth | 20 GB per month | ~10,000+ page views |
| Transformations | 20,000 per month | Auto resize/optimize operations |
| Max Image Size | 10 MB per file | More than enough for web |
| Max Video Size | 100 MB per file | Short clips only |
| Total Assets | 300,000 | Practically unlimited |

#### How Credits Work

**1 credit = 1,000 transformations OR 1 GB storage OR 1 GB bandwidth**

You can flexibly use credits across these three areas based on your needs. For a typical association website:
- You'll use mostly storage (uploading images)
- Some bandwidth (visitors viewing images)
- Minimal transformations (auto-optimization)

**25 credits is more than enough for most association websites.**

### 3.4 Setup Steps

1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) and sign up (no credit card required)
2. Note your **Cloud Name** from the dashboard
3. Go to **Media Library**
4. Create folder structure:
   - Click **Create Folder** → name it `association-site`
   - Inside that, create `events` and `team` folders
5. Upload images:
   - Navigate to the appropriate folder
   - Drag and drop images
6. Get image URL:
   - Click on uploaded image
   - Click **Copy URL** (or right-click → Copy link address)
7. Paste the full URL into your Google Sheet's image column

### 3.5 Recommended Folder Structure

```
your-cloud-name/
└── association-site/
    ├── events/
    │   ├── annual-meet-2025.jpg
    │   ├── workshop-march.jpg
    │   └── conference-2025.jpg
    └── team/
        ├── john-doe.jpg
        ├── jane-smith.jpg
        └── placeholder.jpg
```

### 3.6 Auto-Optimization URLs (Bonus)

Cloudinary can resize and optimize images automatically by modifying the URL. This means you upload ONE high-resolution image and Cloudinary serves optimized versions.

| Need | Add to URL |
|------|------------|
| Resize to 400px wide | `.../upload/w_400/image.jpg` |
| Auto format & quality | `.../upload/f_auto,q_auto/image.jpg` |
| Crop to square (300x300) | `.../upload/w_300,h_300,c_fill/image.jpg` |
| All optimizations | `.../upload/w_400,f_auto,q_auto/image.jpg` |

#### Example

Original URL:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/yourcloud/image/upload/v123456/association-site/team/john-doe.jpg
```

Optimized URL (400px, auto format/quality):
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/yourcloud/image/upload/w_400,f_auto,q_auto/v123456/association-site/team/john-doe.jpg
```

### 3.7 Plan B: GitHub for Images

If Cloudinary is ever unavailable or you exceed limits, images can be stored in GitHub as a fallback.

**Setup:**
- Store in `/images/events/` and `/images/team/` folders
- Use lowercase filenames with hyphens: `annual-meet-2025.jpg`
- Compress images before uploading (use [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com) or [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app))
- Target size: under 200KB per image

**⚠️ Note:** This requires someone with GitHub access to upload images.

## 5. Error Handling & Reliability

### 5.1 Required Error Handling

The website code **must** handle these failure scenarios gracefully:

| Scenario | User Should See | Implementation |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Sheet data fails to load | "Loading..." or cached data | Try/catch with fallback |
| Image URL broken | Placeholder image | `onerror` handler on `<img>` |
| Slow connection | Loading spinner | Loading state in UI |
| Required column missing | Graceful degradation | Validate structure first |
| API quota exceeded | Switch to Plan B | Fallback fetch logic |

### 5.2 Data Validation Requirements

Before displaying data, the website should validate:

- ✅ Required columns exist (title, date, name, etc.)
- ✅ Data array is not empty
- ✅ Date formats are valid
- ✅ Image URLs are properly formatted (if provided)

### 5.3 Client-Side vs Build-Time Fetching

For this architecture, we use **client-side fetching**, which means:

| Aspect | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| When data loads | Every time a visitor loads the page |
| Update visibility | Changes appear immediately (no deploy needed) |
| Initial load speed | Slightly slower (fetching data) |
| SEO | Less optimal (content not in HTML) |
| Best for | Low-to-medium traffic sites |

**Why client-side for this project:**
- Simpler setup
- Instant updates without redeploying
- No build process needed
- Good enough for association website traffic levels

### 5.4 Caching Considerations

For improved performance, consider:

| Strategy | Benefit | Complexity |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Browser caching headers | Reduces repeated fetches | Low |
| LocalStorage cache | Shows last data while refreshing | Medium |
| Service worker | Offline capability | High |

**Recommendation:** Basic browser caching is sufficient for most association sites.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### 7.1 Data Not Updating on Website

**Symptoms:** You updated the Google Sheet but changes don't appear.

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 2-5 minutes (Google Sheets may cache)
2. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. Check sheet is still shared as "Anyone with link"
4. Verify column headers haven't changed
5. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### 7.2 Image Not Displaying

**Symptoms:** Broken image icon or placeholder showing.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the Cloudinary URL is complete and correct
2. Test the URL directly in a new browser tab
3. Check if image was accidentally deleted from Cloudinary
4. Ensure there are no extra spaces in the URL cell
5. Verify the image file isn't corrupted

### 7.3 API Key Not Working

**Symptoms:** Console shows 403 Forbidden or API errors.

**Solutions:**
1. Check domain restrictions match your actual site URL
2. Verify Google Sheets API is enabled in Cloud Console
3. Check if daily quota has been exceeded
4. Ensure the Sheet ID in code matches your actual sheet
5. Try switching to Plan B (CSV publish) temporarily

### 7.4 Website Shows "Loading..." Indefinitely

**Symptoms:** Page never finishes loading data.

**Solutions:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12) → Console tab
2. Look for red error messages
3. Verify Sheet ID in the code matches your actual sheet
4. Check network connectivity
5. Test if Google Sheets is accessible directly
6. Contact developer if issue persists

### 7.5 Cloudinary Showing "Limit Exceeded"

**Symptoms:** New uploads fail or images stop loading.

**Solutions:**
1. Check usage in Cloudinary dashboard
2. Wait until next month for credits to reset
3. Switch to GitHub for images temporarily (Plan B)
4. Delete unused images to free up storage
5. Consider upgrading if limits are consistently hit

### 7.6 CORS Errors (Plan B CSV Method)

**Symptoms:** Console shows "CORS policy" or "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" errors.

**Solutions:**
1. Switch to Plan A (Google Sheets API) - recommended
2. Use a CORS proxy (temporary fix)
3. Ensure the sheet is properly published to web

### 7.7 Preventive Measures

- ✅ Lock the header row in Google Sheets
- ✅ Use data validation for date columns
- ✅ Maintain consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Keep a backup of important images in Google Drive
- ✅ Document who has access to what systems
- ✅ Test changes in incognito/private browser window

## 8. Migration Between Plans

### 8.1 Switching Data Methods (API ↔ CSV)

| Direction | Effort | Steps |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| API → CSV | Low | Change fetch URL, adjust JSON parsing to CSV parsing |
| CSV → API | Low | Get API key, update fetch URL, adjust parsing |

### 8.2 Switching Image Hosts (Cloudinary ↔ GitHub)

| Direction | Effort | Steps |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Cloudinary → GitHub | Medium | Download images, upload to repo, update all URLs in Sheet |
| GitHub → Cloudinary | Medium | Upload images to Cloudinary, update all URLs in Sheet |

### 8.3 Switching Hosting (Netlify ↔ Render)

| Direction | Effort | Steps |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Netlify → Render | Low | Create Render site, connect same GitHub repo, update DNS |
| Render → Netlify | Low | Create Netlify site, connect same GitHub repo, update DNS |

---

## 9. Health Check System

### 9.1 What to Monitor

Create a simple admin page (not linked publicly) that validates:

| Check | What It Verifies |
|-------|------------------|
| ✅ Sheet accessible | API/CSV endpoint returns data |
| ✅ Required columns exist | title, date, name, etc. present |
| ✅ No empty required fields | All entries have minimum data |
| ✅ Image URLs valid | All URLs return HTTP 200 |
| ✅ Cloudinary accessible | Can reach Cloudinary CDN |

### 9.2 Manual Health Check Process

**Weekly (5 minutes):**
1. Visit the website in incognito mode
2. Verify all sections load correctly
3. Check a few images load properly
4. Review Cloudinary usage stats

**Monthly (15 minutes):**
1. Check Google Cloud Console for API errors
2. Review Cloudinary bandwidth usage
3. Verify all team members still have correct access
4. Test the deploy hook still works
